    "# Background\n",
    "In this task, we implemented two different adversarial attacks, namely: \n",
    "   * Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) \n",
    "   * Projected Gradient Descent (PGD).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Fast Gradient Sign Method ([FGSM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6572)) Attack \n",
    "\n",
    "Fast Gradient Sign Method ([FGSM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6572)) Attack is one of the most popular adversarial attacks. While the target model tries to minimize the loss function by adjusting the weights based on the backpropagated gradients, this powerful attack adds pertubation to original input by maximizing the loss function based on the same backpropagated gradients. That is, it produces adversarial examples by adding the original input image ($x$) and the gradients of the neural network of the loss function ($J$) with respect to input data ($\\nabla_xJ(\\theta,x,y)$).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is an attack for a $l_\\infty$-bounded adversary that computes an adversarial example as using the following expression:\n",
    "           \n",
    "$$ x' = x + \\epsilon .sign(\\nabla_xJ(\\theta,x,y))$$ \n",
    "where:\n",
    "* $x'$ is the adversarial image\n",
    "* $x$ is the original input image \n",
    "* $y$ is the original input label \n",
    "* $\\theta$  is the model parameter \n",
    "* $J$ is the loss function\n",
    "* $\\epsilon$ is the magnitude of the perturbation\n",
    "  \n",
    "In essense, this attack can be described as a simple one-iteration scheme for maximizing the inner part of the saddle point formulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Projected Gradient Descent ([PGD](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.06083.pdf)) Attack\n",
    "\n",
    "The Projected Gradient Descent ([PGD](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.06083.pdf)) Attack is a more powerful adversary than the FGSM. As its name suggests, it applies a projected gradient descent on negative loss function. In otherwords, it performs an iteration to find the perturbation that maximises the loss of a model on a particular input while keeping the size of the perturbation smaller than a specific amount specified as epsilon, $\\epsilon$.\n",
    "This method processes adversarial examples as follows until a certain stopping criterion is satisfied:\n",
    " \n",
    "$$ x^{t+1} = x^{t} - \\Pi_{x+S} (x^t + \\alpha sign(\\nabla_xJ(\\theta,x,y)))$$\n",
    "where:\n",
    "* $t$  is the number of iteration\n",
    "and other parameters are as defined above.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is similar to the BIM attack (also know as the Iterative [FGSM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6572)), however, what differentiates them is that the PGD initializes the example to a random point within the available set, as decided by the $l_\\infty$ norm, and also the PGD does random restart.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [PGD](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.06083.pdf) Attack is considered the most complete adversary as it is not limited by any constraints on time  and effort the adversary expends on optimization  to obtain the best attack by iteration."

    "## Expectation Over Transformation (EOT) approach:\n",
    " \n",
    "EOT algorithm, is a general frame work allowing for the construction of adversarial examples that remain adversarial over a chosen transformation distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "When making the adversarial attacks (AEs) in the white-box case, we have a set of possible classes $Y$ and a space of valid inputs $X$ to the classifier. For any class of $y \\in Y$ and input $x \\in X$, the function of $P(y|x)$ and its gradient $\\nabla_xP(y|x)$ are accessible. The AEs can be produced by maximizing the log-likelihood of the target class $y_t$ over a $\\epsilon$-radius ball around the original image (which is showing as a vector of $d$-pixel each in [0,1]): \n",

    "Although this approach were effective in generating the adversarial examples, under image transformations these examples fail to be adversarial. That is why the Expecting Over Transformation (EOT) is defined to fix this issue. The EOT is modeling the peturbations whith optimizing procedure. \n",
    "\n",
    "EOT does not optimize the log-likelihood of a single example, instead it uses a chosen distribution $T$ of transformation functions $t$. It takes an input $x'$ that is controlled by the adversary to the true input $t(x')$. EOT limits the effective distance between the adversarial and original inputs:\n",
